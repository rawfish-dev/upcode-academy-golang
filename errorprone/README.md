## Week 6 Challenge
This is a simple exercise to help you solidify the concept of errors, defer, panic and recover.

#### Description
There is already some code inside which requires some of your help fixing in order to achieve the desired output. Adding a few lines here and there in addition to moving stuff around should help you achieve this quickly.

#### Ground work
Read through the slides for errors, defer, panic and recover before attempting.

#### Tasks
The code does not compile when you've just cloned it, and panics even if you've fixed the compilation error. Walk through the issues slowly and solve them one by one, keeping in the mind the final goal of achieving the output below when you run the program.

```
0 is even, so here's an error
2 is even, so here's an error
4 is even, so here's an error
6 is even, so here's an error
8 is even, so here's an error
Recovered in Execute BOOM
some defered function
another defered function
```
